<h1>Arizona Foreclosure Surplus Funds & Tax Lien Overages Recovery</h1>

<p>After a foreclosure or tax lien sale in Arizona, there are often excess proceeds—also known as surplus funds—left over after the debt is paid. Many former property owners never realize they are entitled to claim this money.</p>

<p>Rightful Returns Recovery helps Arizona property owners recover unclaimed surplus funds from foreclosure trustee sales and tax lien overages.</p>

<h2>What Are Foreclosure Surplus Funds in Arizona?</h2>

<p>In Arizona, most residential foreclosures are conducted through a non-judicial trustee sale process. If the property sells for more than the total amount owed—including the mortgage balance, interest, fees, and costs—the remaining funds are called excess proceeds or surplus funds.</p>

<p>Under Arizona law, these excess proceeds may be claimed by the former property owner or other entitled parties in order of legal priority.</p>

<h2>Arizona Tax Lien Sales & Overages</h2>

<p>Arizona counties conduct tax lien sales when property taxes go unpaid. In some situations, tax lien foreclosures can result in excess proceeds after delinquent taxes, interest, and penalties are satisfied.</p>
